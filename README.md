# 📊 Time Series Forecasting Project

## 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on time series forecasting using a variety of statistical and machine learning models. The aim is to analyze time series data from various domains, perform data preprocessing and visualization, apply different forecasting models, and compare their performances. The goal is to identify the most accurate model for each dataset.

## 🗂️ Structure Overview
- **Notebooks**: Each notebook represents a different time series forecasting task (e.g., road traffic forecasting, stock price prediction).
- **EDA and Preprocessing**: Each notebook includes a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing steps to clean, transform, and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Data Visualization**: Comprehensive visualizations are provided to better understand the data patterns, trends, seasonality, and to illustrate model results.
- **Models**: Commonly used models include ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, Prophet, among others, depending on the dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is assessed using standard metrics, and the best model is selected based on accuracy and other relevant criteria.

## 🔑 Key Features
- EDA and data preprocessing
- Data visualization
- Time series decomposition
- Model fitting
- Prediction generation
- Model evaluation
- Models comparison

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before running the notebooks, ensure that you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**: The project requires Python 3.x to run the scripts and notebooks.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and interacting with the notebooks.
- **Required Libraries**: The necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Prophet, and Scikit-learn are specified within each notebook.

These dependencies can be installed using `pip` commands directly in your environment.

## 🚀 Usage
To explore the analysis:

1. Clone the repository or download the notebooks.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook is independent and self-contained, with specified libraries and installation instructions included within.

## 🌐 Data Sources
Each notebook includes its respective data source. The datasets are either provided within the repository or linked to external sources.
